## Best Practices Summary

### 1. Provide Rich Context

**✅ Good Context Examples:**
- Technology stack (Spring Boot 3, React 18, PostgreSQL 15)
- Scale requirements (500k users, 10k concurrent)
- Performance constraints (<200ms response time)
- Business context (e-commerce, SaaS, compliance requirements)
- Current state (existing implementation, known issues)

**❌ Poor Context Examples:**
- "web app"
- "database issues"
- "make it faster"
- "security problems"

### 2. Use Natural Language for Everything

**✅ Natural Language Pattern:**
```
"Please use the [specific-agent] agent to [specific, actionable task]. [Provide detailed technical and business context]."
```

**❌ What NOT to do:**
```
// Don't try to write tool syntax - it won't work
@workspace Use invoke_agent({...})  // This doesn't work in VS Code
```

**Remember:** VS Code Copilot handles all the technical translation for you!

### 3. Leverage Natural Discovery

```
// When you're not sure which agent to use
"Which agents can help with [your specific technical challenge]?"

// Then use the recommended agent
"Use the [recommended-agent] agent to help me [specific task with full context]"
```

### 4. Structure Follow-up Requests Naturally

```
// Reference previous context for continuity
"Can the security-auditor agent review the authentication system we just designed? Focus on session management and token security in the same Spring Boot system."
```

**Natural continuity phrases:**
- "Based on what we just discussed..."
- "Following up on the previous design..."
- "For the same system we're building..."
