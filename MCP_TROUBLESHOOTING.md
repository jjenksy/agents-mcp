# MCP Server Troubleshooting Guide

> **üöÄ NEW**: The MCP server has been optimized for VS Code Copilot with 75% smaller responses and improved workflow patterns. See the optimization benefits below.

## Common Issues & Solutions

### VS Code Not Using MCP Server

The MCP server is working (as confirmed in Claude Desktop), but VS Code Copilot isn't connecting to it.

## Possible Causes & Solutions

### 1. VS Code Version Requirements

**Check VS Code Version**: You need VS Code 1.99+ for MCP support

```bash
code --version
```

**Update VS Code**: Ensure you have the latest version
- VS Code 1.102+ has full MCP support generally available
- Earlier versions might have limited or experimental support

### 2. GitHub Copilot Extension Version

**Update Extensions**:
1. Open VS Code Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
2. Check for updates to:
   - GitHub Copilot
   - GitHub Copilot Chat
3. Restart VS Code after updates

### 3. Enable Agent Mode

**In VS Code Copilot Chat**:
1. Open Copilot Chat (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Shift+I`)
2. Look for an "Agent Mode" dropdown or toggle
3. Enable Agent Mode if available
4. Look for a "Tools" button to see MCP tools

### 4. MCP Feature Flags

**Enable Experimental Features** (if needed):

Add to your User Settings (`Ctrl+,` ‚Üí Open Settings JSON):
```json
{
  "github.copilot.chat.experimental.mcp.enabled": true,
  "github.copilot.chat.experimental.agents.enabled": true
}
```

### 5. Organization/Enterprise Policies

**If you're using Copilot Business/Enterprise**:
- Your organization admin needs to enable "MCP servers in Copilot" policy
- This policy is disabled by default
- Contact your admin to enable it

**For Copilot Free/Pro users**: No policy restrictions

### 6. Alternative: Global MCP Configuration

Instead of workspace-specific configuration, try global configuration:

**Add to User Settings JSON** (`~/.vscode/settings.json` or through VS Code settings):
```json
{
  "github.copilot.chat.mcp.servers": {
    "ai-agents": {
      "command": "java",
      "args": [
        "-jar",
        "/Users/johnjenkins/java-projects/jenksy.me/jenksy-mcp/build/libs/jenksy-mcp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check MCP Server Status
```bash
# Test that server starts properly
java -jar build/libs/jenksy-mcp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
# Should show Spring Boot startup logs
```

### 2. Look for MCP Indicators in VS Code
- Open Copilot Chat
- Look for "Agent Mode" or "Tools" options
- Check for MCP server status in VS Code status bar
- Look for MCP-related notifications

### 3. Alternative Testing

**Test with Claude Desktop** (which works):
```json
// In claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ai-agents": {
      "command": "java",
      "args": ["-jar", "/Users/johnjenkins/java-projects/jenksy.me/jenksy-mcp/build/libs/jenksy-mcp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Current Status

**MCP Server**: Working (tested with Claude Desktop)
**Agent Loading**: 10 agents loaded from `agents/` directory
**Spring Boot**: Server starts successfully
**VS Code Integration**: Not connecting to MCP server

## Next Steps

1. **Check VS Code Version**: Ensure 1.99+
2. **Update Extensions**: Get latest Copilot extensions
3. **Look for Agent Mode**: In Copilot Chat interface
4. **Try Global Config**: Add to user settings instead of workspace
5. **Check Enterprise Policy**: If using Copilot Business/Enterprise

## How to Use MCP in VS Code (When Working)

Once MCP integration is working, use **natural language** in VS Code Copilot:

### ‚úÖ Correct: Natural Language Requests
```
"I need the security-auditor agent to review our authentication implementation for vulnerabilities. We're using Spring Security 6 with JWT tokens in a microservices architecture."
```

**How it works:**
- You type naturally in Copilot Chat
- VS Code Copilot parses your request
- It automatically calls the appropriate MCP tools
- You get expert guidance without knowing tool syntax

### ‚ùå Wrong: Direct Tool Syntax (Doesn't Work)
```javascript
// This syntax doesn't work in VS Code Copilot
@workspace Use invoke_agent({...})  // Won't work!
@workspace Use get_agent_info("security-auditor")  // Won't work!
```

**Remember:** VS Code Copilot is designed for natural language interaction, not direct tool calls.

## Fallback: Manual Agent Usage

If MCP integration doesn't work immediately, you have options:

### Option 1: Use Claude Desktop (Direct Tools Work)
```javascript
// Claude Desktop supports direct tool syntax
invoke_agent({
  "agentName": "security-auditor",
  "task": "Review authentication code",
  "context": "Spring Security JWT implementation"
})
```
Then copy the response to VS Code.

### Option 2: Natural Language in VS Code (When MCP Works)
```
"Use the security-auditor agent to review my authentication code using Spring Security with JWT implementation"
```

### Option 3: Manual Prompt Copy
Copy agent prompts from the `agents/` directory and paste into VS Code Copilot Chat.

## Report Issue

If MCP still doesn't work after these steps:
1. Report to GitHub Copilot support
2. Include VS Code version, Copilot extension versions
3. Include MCP configuration details
4. Mention that MCP server works with Claude Desktop

The MCP protocol is still relatively new in VS Code, so there might be compatibility issues or missing features being rolled out gradually.
