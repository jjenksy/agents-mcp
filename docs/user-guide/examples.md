## Backend Development

### Example 1: Designing a Microservices API

**Scenario**: Building a user management service for an e-commerce platform

#### Optimized Workflow

```javascript
// Single comprehensive call
@workspace Use invoke_agent({
  "agentName": "backend-architect",
  "task": "Design a user management microservice API with authentication and profile management",
  "context": "E-commerce platform, Spring Boot 3, expecting 500k users, JWT auth, microservices architecture, event-driven communication"
})
```

#### Expected Response (Optimized)

```markdown
## BACKEND-ARCHITECT SPECIALIST
> Design RESTful APIs, microservice boundaries, and database schemas

### Task Analysis
**Objective**: Design a user management microservice API with authentication and profile management
**Context**: E-commerce platform, Spring Boot 3, expecting 500k users, JWT auth, microservices architecture, event-driven communication

### Recommended Approach
1. Define clear API boundaries: /auth/** for authentication, /users/** for profile management, /admin/** for user administration
2. Implement JWT with refresh token strategy, store refresh tokens in Redis for horizontal scaling
3. Design event-driven user lifecycle: UserRegistered, UserActivated, ProfileUpdated events published to message broker
4. Apply CQRS pattern for read-heavy profile queries vs write-heavy auth operations

### Expert Context
```
You are a backend system architect specializing in scalable API design and microservices...
```
```

**Why This Works:**
- **Context-Rich**: Specific technology stack and scale requirements
- **Actionable**: 4 concrete architectural decisions
- **Complete**: Authentication, data, events, and patterns all addressed
- **Optimized**: ~1.2KB response vs 4-6KB with old workflow

### Example 2: API Performance Optimization

**Scenario**: Existing API is slow under load

```javascript
@workspace Use invoke_agent({
  "agentName": "backend-architect",
  "task": "Optimize REST API performance for high-traffic user operations",
  "context": "Spring Boot app, 10k concurrent users, database queries taking 2-5s, Redis available, PostgreSQL backend"
})
```

**Key Benefits:**
- Immediate focus on performance optimization
- Technology-specific recommendations (Redis, PostgreSQL)
- Concrete metrics (10k concurrent, 2-5s queries)

## Best Practices Summary

### 1. Provide Rich Context

**✅ Good Context Examples:**
- Technology stack (Spring Boot 3, React 18, PostgreSQL 15)
- Scale requirements (500k users, 10k concurrent)
- Performance constraints (<200ms response time)
- Business context (e-commerce, SaaS, compliance requirements)
- Current state (existing implementation, known issues)

**❌ Poor Context Examples:**
- "web app"
- "database issues"
- "make it faster"
- "security problems"

### 2. Use Single-Call Workflows

**✅ Optimized Pattern:**
```javascript
@workspace Use invoke_agent({
  "agentName": "specific-agent",
  "task": "specific, actionable task",
  "context": "detailed technical and business context"
})
```

**❌ Inefficient Pattern:**
```javascript
@workspace Use get_agent_info("agent")
@workspace Use get_agent_prompt("agent")
// Then manually construct request
```

### 3. Leverage Smart Discovery

```javascript
// When you're not sure which agent to use
@workspace Use get_recommended_agents("your specific technical challenge")

// Then use the recommended agent with full context
@workspace Use invoke_agent({...})
```

### 4. Structure Follow-up Requests

```javascript
// Reference previous context for continuity
@workspace Use invoke_agent({
  "agentName": "security-auditor",
  "task": "Review the authentication system designed in previous response",
  "context": "Same Spring Boot system, now focus on session management and token security"
})
```
